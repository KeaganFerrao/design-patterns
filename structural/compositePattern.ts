// Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree 
// structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

// Using the Composite pattern makes sense only when the core model of your app can be represented as a tree.

// For example, imagine that you have two types of objects: Products and Boxes. A Box can contain
// several Products as well as a number of smaller Boxes. These little Boxes can also hold some Products 
// or even smaller Boxes, and so on.

// It might be difficult to provide a common interface for classes whose functionality differs too much.
// In certain scenarios, youâ€™d need to overgeneralize the component interface, making it harder to comprehend.
